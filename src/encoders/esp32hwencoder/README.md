# SimpleFOC Driver for ESP32 hardware encoder

This encoder driver uses the ESP32Â´s dedicated pulse counter hardware to efficiently count the AB(I) signals of an encoder. 

Because most of the counting is done by the peripheral, it should support much higher speeds in comparison to the generic interrupt-based encoder implementation provided in the main library. 

## Warning

Currently very much untested!

## Hardware Setup

You can connect the encoder to any digital input pin of the ESP32, as they all support the PCNT peripheral.

## Configuration

It should support encoders with a cpr of up to 31 bits. (At this resolution, you would get about 100 counts per second if you mounted such a sensor on the earths rotational axis. Thats plenty ;-) ) 

This is a near drop-in replacement for the standard encoder class:

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include "SimpleFOC.h"
#include "SimpleFOCDrivers.h"
#include "encoders/esp32hwencoder/ESP32HWEncoder.h"

#define ENCODER_PPR 4711
#define ENCODER_PIN_A 16
#define ENCODER_PIN_B 17
#define ENCODER_PIN_I 21

ESP32HWEncoder sensor = ESP32HWEncoder(ENCODER_PIN_A, ENCODER_PIN_B, ENCODER_PPR, ENCODER_PIN_I); // The encoder pin can be omitted

void setup() {
    encoder.pullup = Pullup::USE_INTERN; // optional: pullups

    encoder.init();
}
```
